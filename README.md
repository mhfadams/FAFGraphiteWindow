FAFGraphiteWindow
==============


Introduction
------------
FAFGraphiteWindow is part of my ongoing efforts to return to the visual interface of OS-9 which I miss terribly.

Features
---------
- Nearly identical window look to the old classic look, except slightly crisper, and with OS-X long-light shadow rather than Classic short black shadow.
- "Windowshade" button and title-bar doubleclick.



Platforms
------------
FAFGraphiteWindow is targeted to Tiger and Leopard, but may work for a much broader lineup.



Issues
------
FAFGraphiteWindow is stable and fully functional, with a few issues outstanding:
- Toolbar support has not been attempted yet.
- Sheets display correctly, however Drawers do not (they misalign with the window edge).
- There may be other issues in the same line which I have not yet noticed.
- tacky (though functional) window buttons for those who have not supplied images of the OS-9 window buttons.


Setup
----------------------------------------------
FAFGraphiteWindow is not quite a drop in replacement for NSWindow, although nearly so.
Unlike NSWindow, there is a status bar zone at the bottom edge, which is separate from the main content view.
FAFGraphiteWindow can be created from both code and nib.
